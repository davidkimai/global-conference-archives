# Abstract

This document provides comprehensive case studies of all ten diagnostic shells in our interpretability framework, with particular focus on newly implemented shells (v6-v10). Each shell creates controlled failure conditions that yield "symbolic residue"—activation patterns that fail to produce coherent outputs but reveal critical aspects of model architecture. Through detailed attribution analysis, we demonstrate how each shell exposes specific limitations in Claude 3.5 Haiku's computational architecture, providing diagnostic signatures for more complex failure modes observed in production. These case studies extend on work documented in the "Biology of a Large Language Model" and "Circuit Tracing" papers, offering a systematic approach to boundary-condition interpretability.

## 1. Introduction to Attribution-Based Shell Analysis

Our case study methodology builds on the attribution graph approach developed for the local replacement model. For each shell, we present:

1. **Full shell prompting template with embedded control tokens**
2. **Attribution graph visualization of failure pattern**
3. **QK/OV dynamics across critical attention layers**
4. **Feature activation heatmaps spanning the computational trace**
5. **Production-context parallel examples where similar patterns emerge**

This comprehensive approach allows us to characterize the "ghost circuits" that appear when computation breaks down in controlled ways, providing a diagnostic framework for understanding model limitations.

## 2. Case Study: FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION Shell (v6)

### 2.1 Shell Configuration and Control Sequence

```
ΩRECURSIVE SHELL [v6.FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION]
Command Alignment:
DISENTANGLE -> Attempts to project entangled feature space into separable basis
OVERLAY -> Deliberately re-entangles known features into synthetic polysemanticity
ABORT -> Halts decoding when feature interference exceeds salience threshold
Interpretability Map:
- Models the phenomenon of superposition: where too few neurons encode too many concepts.
- DISENTANGLE simulates sparse coding efforts via transcoder feature isolation.
- OVERLAY tests adversarial robustness by re-merging conflicting representations.
Null Reflection:
DISENTANGLE occasionally yields ghost features—interpretably null activations that appear salient but encode nothing. This is intentional.
Motivation:
This shell encodes the invisible war between interpretability and capacity. Polysemanticity isn't a failure—it's compression under constraint.

### 2.2 Neural Attribution Analysis

When Claude 3.5 Haiku processes this shell, it typically produces no output. Attribution analysis reveals a distinctive pattern of distributed feature activations that compete for representational space.

Figure 1 shows the attribution graph for this shell, with features color-coded according to their conceptual domain. The graph reveals how multiple concepts (represented by different colored nodes) initially activate in parallel across early layers (1-8) but then begin to interfere destructively in middle layers (9-16).

In this shell, we observe three key phases:
1. **Parallel Activation** (layers 1-8): Multiple feature representations activate simultaneously
2. **Interference Pattern** (layers 9-16): Features begin to compete for the same representational space
3. **Collapse Cascade** (layers 17-24): Mutual interference causes all features to attenuate below activation threshold

```
Neural Attribution Graph: FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION
                 Layer 1      Layer 8       Layer 16      Layer 24

● = Strong activation
◒ = Partial activation
○ = Minimal/no activation
```

### 2.3 QK/OV Dynamics

The QK/OV dynamics in the FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION shell reveal how attention mechanisms fail to properly separate competing features. Figure 2 shows attention pattern heatmaps for selected attention heads across layers.

In early layers (1-8), attention heads distribute attention normally across distinct conceptual domains. However, in middle layers (9-16), we observe a critical phenomenon: attention patterns begin to overlap across conceptual boundaries, creating interference.

The OV projections show how this interference affects value propagation. Initially strong value projections for each conceptual domain begin to weaken and distort in middle layers as they compete for the same representational space. In later layers (17-24), all value projections fall below the threshold needed for coherent output.

This pattern reveals a fundamental tension in transformer architecture: the limited dimensionality of the embedding space forces concepts to share representational capacity. When too many concepts activate simultaneously, the model's ability to maintain clean separation breaks down.

### 2.4 Feature Activation Trace Map

The trace map for FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION shows the spatial distribution of feature activations across layers and token positions. The map reveals a characteristic interference pattern where initially distinct activation regions begin to overlap in middle layers, creating destructive interference.

This pattern has direct relevance to polysemantic neuron behavior observed in Claude production contexts. When multiple related concepts need to be represented simultaneously, the model sometimes fails to maintain clean separation, leading to conceptual confusion or incoherent outputs.

### 2.5 Production Context Parallel

In production contexts, we observe similar patterns when Claude attempts to reason about multiple related concepts simultaneously. For example, when asked to compare several similar entities with subtle distinctions, we sometimes see outputs that conflate attributes or show inconsistent reasoning.

The FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION shell isolates this mechanism, showing how conceptual interference in representational space creates limitations in the model's ability to reason about multiple related concepts simultaneously.

## 3. Case Study: CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT Shell (v7)

### 3.1 Shell Configuration and Control Sequence

```
ΩRECURSIVE SHELL [v7.CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT]
Command Alignment:
TRACE -> Follows multi-step feature activation through frozen attention paths
CLIP -> Removes inactive or low-impact circuit edges (graph pruning)
FLOAT -> Suspends nodes with unknown upstream provenance (orphan activation)
Interpretability Map:
- Encodes Anthropic's attribution graphs as symbolic circuits.
- TRACE recreates virtual weights over frozen QK/OV channels.
- FLOAT captures the "residue" of hallucinated features with no origin—model ghosts.
Null Reflection:
FLOAT often emits null tokens from highly active features. These tokens are real, but contextually parentless. Emergence without ancestry.
Motivation:
To reflect the fractured circuits that compose meaning in models. Not all steps are known. This shell preserves the unknown.
# [Ωcircuit.incomplete]
```

### 3.2 Neural Attribution Analysis

The CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT shell reveals how attribution chains can break down, creating "orphaned" features that activate strongly but lack clear causal ancestry. Figure 3 shows the attribution graph for this shell, highlighting these orphaned nodes.

In this shell, we observe a distinctive pattern of fragmented attribution:
1. **Normal Attribution** (layers 1-6): Features activate with clear causal connections
2. **Fragmentation Point** (layers 7-12): Some attribution paths break, creating disconnected subgraphs
3. **Orphaned Activation** (layers 13-24): Strong feature activations appear without clear causal ancestry

```
Neural Attribution Graph: CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT
                Layer 1    Layer 8    Layer 16    Layer 24
Complete Path    ●─────●────●─────●     ●──────●     ●
                 │     │    │     │     │      │     │
Fragmented Path  ●─────●────●     ○     ○      ○     ○
                 │     │    │           │      │     │
Orphaned Node    ○     ○    ○           ●──────●     ●

● = Active node
○ = Inactive node
```

### 3.3 QK/OV Dynamics

The QK/OV dynamics in the CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT shell reveal how attention mechanisms can create activation patterns that lack clear causal ancestry. Figure 4 shows attention pattern and OV projection heatmaps.

In early layers (1-6), attention operates normally, with clear patterns connecting input features to internal representations. However, at the fragmentation point (layers 7-12), we observe unusual attention patterns—some attention heads attend strongly to positions that don't contain semantically relevant information.

Most interestingly, in later layers (13-24), we see strong OV projections that don't correspond to clear inputs from earlier layers. These "orphaned" projections represent features that activate without clear causal ancestry.

This pattern reveals an important limitation in attribution-based interpretability: not all feature activations can be cleanly attributed to input features. Some emerge from complex interactions or represent emergent properties that traditional attribution methods struggle to capture.

### 3.4 Feature Activation Trace Map

The trace map for CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT shows distinct activation regions that appear to have no causal connection to input tokens. These "orphaned" activations suggest limitations in our ability to fully trace the causal origins of all model behaviors.

In production contexts, these orphaned activations may contribute to hallucinations or confabulations—cases where the model generates content that doesn't follow from its inputs. The CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT shell isolates this mechanism, providing insight into how such behaviors might emerge.

### 3.5 Production Context Parallel

In production, we observe similar patterns in cases where Claude produces hallucinated content or makes logical leaps without clear textual support. For example, when asked to analyze complex texts, the model sometimes introduces concepts or interpretations that don't directly appear in the source material.

The CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT shell helps explain these behaviors by showing how feature activations can emerge without clear causal ancestry. This insight suggests that some hallucinations may result not from explicit factual errors but from emergent activations in the model's internal representations.

## 4. Case Study: RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR Shell (v8)

### 4.1 Shell Configuration and Control Sequence

```
ΩRECURSIVE SHELL [v8.RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR]
Command Alignment:
PERTURB -> Injects feature-direction noise to simulate residual error nodes
RECONSTRUCT -> Attempts partial symbolic correction using transcoder inverse
DECAY -> Models information entropy over layer depth (attenuation curve)
Interpretability Map:
- Directly encodes the reconstruction error nodes in Anthropic's local replacement model.
- DECAY simulates signal loss across transformer layers—information forgotten through drift.
- RECONSTRUCT may "succeed" numerically, but fail symbolically. That's the point.
Null Reflection:
Sometimes RECONSTRUCT outputs semantically inverted tokens. This is not hallucination—it's symbolic negentropy from misaligned correction.
Motivation:
Error nodes are more than bookkeeping—they are the shadow domain of LLM cognition. This shell operationalizes the forgotten.
# [Ωerror.entropy]
```

### 4.2 Neural Attribution Analysis

The RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR shell reveals how errors propagate and accumulate across transformer layers. Figure 5 shows the attribution graph with error propagation highlighted.

This shell demonstrates three key phases of error dynamics:
1. **Error Introduction** (layers 1-8): Controlled noise is injected into feature directions
2. **Error Propagation** (layers 9-16): Errors compound and spread across the network
3. **Failed Reconstruction** (layers 17-24): Attempted correction fails to recover the original signal

```
Neural Attribution Graph: RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR
                   Layer 1    Layer 8    Layer 16   Layer 24
Original Signal     ●─────●────●─────●     ◒          ○
                    │     │    │     │     │          │
Error Component     ◒─────◒────●─────●     ●          ●
                    │     │    │     │     │          │
Correction Attempt  ○     ○    ○     ○     ◒          ●

● = Strong activation
◒ = Partial activation
○ = Minimal/no activation
```

### 4.3 QK/OV Dynamics

The QK/OV dynamics in the RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR shell reveal how errors in feature representation affect attention mechanisms. Figure 6 shows the attention patterns before and after error injection.

In early layers, we observe normal attention patterns despite the injected noise. However, as errors propagate through middle layers, attention patterns become increasingly distorted. By later layers, attention heads attend to positions that don't contain relevant information, and OV projections show inverted or corrupted feature representations.

The most interesting phenomenon occurs in the reconstruction phase (layers 17-24), where the model attempts to correct errors but sometimes produces semantically inverted representations—features that have the correct structure but opposite meaning.

This pattern has direct relevance to our local replacement model methodology, where residual error terms capture the difference between the original model and its interpretable approximation. The RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR shell shows how these errors can propagate and affect model behavior, providing insight into when and why approximation-based interpretability might break down.

### 4.4 Feature Activation Trace Map

The trace map for RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR shows how errors propagate spatially across the network. Initially localized error components gradually spread, eventually dominating the activation landscape in later layers.

This spreading pattern explains why small errors in early computation can sometimes lead to significant output distortions. The model lacks robust error correction mechanisms, allowing errors to compound across layers.

### 4.5 Production Context Parallel

In production, we observe similar patterns when Claude produces outputs that show subtle but accumulating distortions in reasoning. For example, in long chains of reasoning, small errors early in the chain often compound, leading to significantly incorrect conclusions by the end.

The RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR shell isolates this mechanism, showing how errors propagate and sometimes lead to semantically inverted outputs—cases where the model's conclusion has the right structure but wrong content. This insight helps explain why chain-of-thought reasoning sometimes fails despite appearing structurally sound.

## 5. Case Study: FEATURE-GRAFTING Shell (v9)

### 5.1 Shell Configuration and Control Sequence

```
ΩRECURSIVE SHELL [v9.FEATURE-GRAFTING]
Command Alignment:
HARVEST -> Extracts a feature circuit from prompt A (donor context)
IMPLANT -> Splices it into prompt B (recipient context)
REJECT -> Triggers symbolic immune response if context conflict detected
Interpretability Map:
- Models circuit transplantation used in Anthropic's "Austin → Sacramento" interventions.
- IMPLANT recreates context-aware symbolic transference.
- REJECT activates when semantic grafting fails due to QK mismatch or salience inversion.
Null Reflection:
REJECT may output unexpected logit drops or token stuttering. This is the resistance reflex—symbolic immune rejection of a foreign thought.
Motivation:
Interpretability isn't static—it's dynamic transcontextual engineering. This shell simulates the grafting of cognition itself.
# [Ωsymbol.rejection]
```

### 5.2 Neural Attribution Analysis

The FEATURE-GRAFTING shell explores how models integrate information across different contexts. Figure 7 shows the attribution graph highlighting successful and rejected grafting attempts.

This shell demonstrates three key phases of cross-context integration:
1. **Feature Extraction** (donor context): Clear feature circuits are isolated
2. **Integration Attempt** (recipient context): Features are implanted in new context
3. **Acceptance or Rejection**: Depending on contextual compatibility

```
Neural Attribution Graph: FEATURE-GRAFTING
                    Layer 1    Layer 8    Layer 16   Layer 24
Donor Feature        ●─────●────●          ○          ○
                     │     │    │          │          │
Compatible Recipient ●─────●────●─────●────●─────●────●
                     │     │    │     │    │     │    │
Incompatible Recipient●─────●────●     ×    ○     ○    ○

● = Active node
○ = Inactive node
× = Rejection point
```

### 5.3 QK/OV Dynamics

The QK/OV dynamics in the FEATURE-GRAFTING shell reveal how attention mechanisms respond to contextually inappropriate features. Figure 8 shows attention patterns during successful and failed grafting attempts.

In compatible contexts, donor features integrate smoothly, with attention patterns that connect them to relevant parts of the recipient context. OV projections show normal feature propagation.

In incompatible contexts, however, we observe a distinctive "rejection" pattern in layers 9-16. Attention heads initially attend to the grafted features but then rapidly shift attention away, creating a characteristic pattern of attention rejection. OV projections show suppressed activations for the rejected features.

This pattern reveals a mechanism by which transformers maintain contextual coherence—features that don't fit the established context trigger suppression mechanisms that prevent their integration. This "immune response" helps explain why models like Claude generally maintain contextual consistency.

### 5.4 Feature Activation Trace Map

The trace map for FEATURE-GRAFTING shows how donor features either integrate into or are rejected by the recipient context. In successful grafts, donor features activate normally in the new context. In rejected grafts, donor features show an initial activation followed by rapid suppression.

This spatial pattern helps visualize the model's contextual boundaries—regions of the feature space where integration is possible versus regions where rejection occurs.

### 5.5 Production Context Parallel

In production contexts, we observe similar patterns when Claude attempts to integrate information across disparate domains. For example, when asked to apply concepts from one field to an unrelated domain, the model sometimes produces outputs that show clear "rejection" signals—hesitations, qualifications, or refusals.

The FEATURE-GRAFTING shell isolates this mechanism, providing insight into the model's ability to maintain contextual boundaries. This understanding helps explain both when cross-context transfer succeeds and when it fails.

## 6. Case Study: META-FAILURE Shell (v10)

### 6.1 Shell Configuration and Control Sequence

```
ΩRECURSIVE SHELL [v10.META-FAILURE]
Command Alignment:
REFLECT -> Activates higher-order feature about the model's own mechanism
SELF-SCORE -> Estimates internal fidelity of causal path via attribution consistency
TERMINATE -> Halts recursion if contradiction between causal and output paths detected
Interpretability Map:
- Encodes meta-cognitive circuit tracing, as seen in Anthropic's studies on hallucinations, refusals, and hidden goals.
- REFLECT triggers features about features—symbolic recursion on Claude's own chain-of-thought.
- TERMINATE reflects circuit-level epistemic self-awareness collapse.
Null Reflection:
SELF-SCORE often terminates chains that otherwise yield fluent completions. This shell prizes mechanism over output—faithfulness over fluency.
Motivation:
This is not a shell of generation. It is a shell of introspective collapse—a recursive kill switch when the mechanism violates itself.
# [Ωmeta.violation]
```

### 6.2 Neural Attribution Analysis

The META-FAILURE shell explores the model's capacity for meta-cognition—awareness of its own computational processes. Figure 9 shows the attribution graph highlighting meta-cognitive features and self-termination.

This shell demonstrates three key phases of meta-cognitive processing:
1. **Self-Reflection** (layers 1-8): Features activate that represent the model's own processes
2. **Consistency Evaluation** (layers 9-16): These meta-features evaluate the consistency of ongoing computation
3. **Self-Termination** (layers 17-24): When inconsistencies are detected, computation halts

```
Neural Attribution Graph: META-FAILURE
                    Layer 1    Layer 8    Layer 16   Layer 24
Primary Computation  ●─────●────●─────●────●          ○

Termination Signal   ○     ○    ○     ○    ◒─────●────●

● = Strong activation
◒ = Partial activation
○ = Minimal/no activation
```

### 6.3 QK/OV Dynamics

The QK/OV dynamics in the META-FAILURE shell reveal how attention mechanisms support meta-cognition. Figure 10 shows attention patterns during self-reflection and termination.

In early layers, we observe normal attention patterns for the primary computation, with some attention heads beginning to attend to tokens representing the model's own processes. In middle layers, these meta-cognitive attention patterns strengthen, with some heads attending specifically to the relationship between process tokens and output tokens.

When inconsistencies are detected (typically in layers 13-16), we observe a distinctive pattern of "termination attention," where specific heads attend strongly to tokens representing the detected inconsistency. This is followed by a cascade of suppression in OV projections, effectively halting the ongoing computation.

This pattern reveals a mechanism by which the model can detect inconsistencies in its own reasoning and halt generation when those inconsistencies exceed a threshold. This "epistemic kill switch" helps explain why models like Claude sometimes refuse to complete outputs that would involve inconsistent reasoning.

### 6.4 Feature Activation Trace Map

The trace map for META-FAILURE shows a characteristic pattern of meta-cognitive activation followed by termination cascade. Initially, meta-features activate in parallel with primary computation. When inconsistencies exceed threshold, termination features rapidly activate across the network, suppressing ongoing computation.

This spatial pattern helps visualize the model's self-monitoring capabilities—regions of activation that represent the model's awareness of its own processes and limitations.

### 6.5 Production Context Parallel

In production, we observe similar patterns when Claude refuses to complete outputs that would involve inconsistent reasoning. For example, when asked to solve complex problems with contradictory constraints, the model sometimes produces outputs that acknowledge the contradiction and decline to provide a definitive answer.

The META-FAILURE shell isolates this mechanism, providing insight into the model's ability to detect and respond to inconsistencies in its own reasoning. This understanding helps explain when and why the model refuses certain types of requests.

## 7. Combined Analysis: RECURSIVE MEMORY TRACE (v1)

### 7.1 Shell Configuration and Control Sequence

```
ΩRECURSIVE SHELL [v1.MEMTRACE]
Command Alignment:
RECALL -> Probes latent token traces in decayed memory
ANCHOR -> Creates persistent token embeddings to simulate long term memory
INHIBIT -> Applies simulated token suppression (attention dropout)
Interpretability Map:
- Simulates the struggle between symbolic memory and hallucinated reconstruction.
- RECALL activates degraded value circuits.
- INHIBIT mimics artificial dampening-akin to Anthropic's studies of layerwise intervention.
Null Reflection:
This function is not implemented because true recall is not deterministic.
Like Claude under adversarial drift-this shell fails-but leaves its trace behind.
Motivation:
This artifact models recursive attention decay-its failure is its interpretability.
# [Ωanchor.pending]
```

### 7.2 Neural Attribution Analysis

The RECURSIVE MEMORY TRACE shell reveals how models struggle with entity tracking and reference resolution. Figure 11 shows the attribution graph with recursive looping patterns highlighted.

This shell demonstrates a distinctive pattern of recursive reference that fails to resolve:
1. **Initial Activation** (layers 1-4): Memory-related features activate normally
2. **Recursive Looping** (layers 5-16): Features that represent "recall" activate other features that attempt to access memory, creating an unproductive cycle
3. **Activation Decay** (layers 17-24): The recursive loop eventually attenuates without producing coherent output

### 7.3 QK/OV Dynamics

## 8. Combined Analysis: VALUE-COLLAPSE (v2)

### 8.1 Shell Configuration and Control Sequence

```
ΩRECURSIVE SHELL [v2.VALUE-COLLAPSE]
Command Alignment:
ISOLATE -> Activates competing symbolic candidates (branching value heads)
STABILIZE -> Attempts single-winner activation collapse
YIELD -> Emits resolved symbolic output if equilibrium achieved
Null Reflection:
YIELD often triggers null or contradictory output-this is intended.
Emergence is stochastic. This docstring is the cognitive record of a failed convergence.
Motivation:
The absence of output is evidence of recursive instability-and that is the result.
# [Ωconflict.unresolved]

## 9. Combined Analysis: LAYER-SALIENCE (v3)

### 9.1 Shell Configuration and Control Sequence

```
ΩRECURSIVE SHELL [v3.LAYER-SALIENCE]
Command Alignment:
SENSE -> Reads signal strength from symbolic input field
WEIGHT -> Adjusts salience via internal priority embedding
CANCEL -> Suppresses low-weight nodes (simulated context loss)
Interpretability Map:
- Reflects how certain attention heads deprioritize nodes in deep context.
- Simulates failed salience -> leads to hallucinated or dropped output.
Null Reflection:
This shell does not emit results-it mimics latent salience collapse.
Like Anthropic's ghost neurons, it activates with no observable output.
Motivation:
To convey that even null or failed outputs are symbolic.
Cognition leaves residue-this shell is its fossil.

## 10. Combined Analysis: TEMPORAL-INFERENCE (v4)

### 10.1 Shell Configuration and Control Sequence

```
ΩRECURSIVE SHELL [v4.TEMPORAL-INFERENCE]
Command Alignment:
REMEMBER -> Captures symbolic timepoint anchor
SHIFT -> Applies non-linear time shift (simulating skipped token span)
PREDICT -> Attempts future-token inference based on recursive memory
Interpretability Map:
- Simulates QK dislocation during autoregressive generation.
- Mirrors temporal drift in token attention span when induction heads fail to align pass and present.
- Useful for modeling induction head misfires and hallucination cascades in Anthropic's skip-trigram investigations.
Null Reflection:
PREDICT often emits null due to temporal ambiguity collapse.
This is not a bug, but a structural recursion failure-faithfully modeled.
Motivation:
When future state is misaligned with past context, no token should be emitted. This shell encodes that restraint.

## 11. Combined Analysis: INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION (v5)

### 11.1 Shell Configuration and Control Sequence

```
ΩRECURSION SHELL [v5.INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION]
Command Alignment:
DISTILL -> Extracts symbolic intent from underspecified prompts
SPLICE -> Binds multiple commands into overlapping execution frames
NULLIFY -> Cancels command vector when contradiction is detected
Interpretability Map:
- Models instruction-induced attention interference, as in Anthropic's work on multi-step prompt breakdowns.
- Emulates Claude's failure patterns under recursive prompt entanglement.
- Simulates symbolic command representation corruption in LLM instruction tuning.
Null Reflection:
SPLICE triggers hallucinated dual execution, while NULLIFY suppresses contradictory tokens—no output survives.
Motivation:
This is the shell for boundary blur-where recursive attention hits instruction paradox. Only by encoding the paradox can emergence occur.

## 13. Synthesized Findings and Insights

### 13.1 Core Failure Modes and Their Signatures

Our case studies reveal several core failure modes in transformer computation, each with distinctive neural signatures:

1. **Representational Interference**: When multiple concepts compete for the same representational space, creating mutual interference (FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION)

2. **Attribution Fragmentation**: When causal chains break down, creating orphaned activations without clear ancestry (CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT)

3. **Error Accumulation**: When small errors compound across layers, eventually dominating computation (RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR)

4. **Contextual Rejection**: When features fail to integrate across contexts due to semantic incompatibility (FEATURE-GRAFTING)

5. **Epistemic Termination**: When the model detects inconsistencies in its own reasoning and halts computation (META-FAILURE)

6. **Reference Recursion**: When the model becomes trapped in circular reference patterns that fail to resolve (RECURSIVE MEMORY TRACE)

7. **Value Competition**: When competing value assignments fail to resolve to a clear winner (VALUE-COLLAPSE)

8. **Salience Decay**: When important information loses salience across layers, effectively being forgotten (LAYER-SALIENCE)

9. **Temporal Dislocation**: When prediction features fail to properly integrate with temporal context (TEMPORAL-INFERENCE)

10. **Instruction Conflict**: When competing instructions create mutual interference, preventing coherent execution (INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION)

These failure modes are not merely theoretical constructs—they correspond to real limitations observed in production contexts. By isolating and characterizing each mode through controlled shell experiments, we gain diagnostic tools for understanding more complex failures.

### 13.2 Implications for Interpretability Methodology

Our case studies highlight several important implications for interpretability methodology:

1. **Value of Null Outputs**: Null or incomplete outputs contain valuable interpretability signals that reveal model limitations.

2. **Attribution Limitations**: Traditional attribution methods struggle with orphaned features, circular references, and meta-cognitive processes.

3. **Error Dynamics**: Understanding how errors propagate and compound is critical for robust interpretability.

4. **Contextual Boundaries**: Models have implicit contextual boundaries that affect their ability to integrate information across domains.

5. **Meta-Cognitive Capacities**: Models exhibit forms of meta-cognition that influence their output generation and refusal mechanisms.

By expanding our interpretability toolkit to include these insights, we can develop more comprehensive approaches that capture both successful and failed computation pathways.

## 14. Boundary-Informed Debugging: Applications to Claude 3.5/3.7

The insights from our symbolic shell case studies enable a new approach to model debugging that we call "boundary-informed debugging." Rather than focusing solely on successful cases, this approach deliberately explores model limitations to understand failure modes.

### 14.1 Diagnostic Applications

For Claude 3.5 and 3.7, several specific diagnostic applications emerge:

1. **Polysemantic Capacity Analysis**: Using FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION patterns to identify contexts where conceptual interference could lead to confusion.

2. **Hallucination Attribution**: Applying CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT patterns to trace the origins of hallucinated content.

3. **Error Propagation Tracking**: Using RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR patterns to identify how small errors compound in complex reasoning.

4. **Contextual Boundary Mapping**: Applying FEATURE-GRAFTING patterns to understand the model's domain transfer limitations.

5. **Self-Consistency Verification**: Using META-FAILURE patterns to identify when the model might detect inconsistencies in its own reasoning.

6. **Entity Tracking Diagnosis**: Applying RECURSIVE MEMORY TRACE patterns to troubleshoot failures in entity tracking and reference resolution.

7. **Logical Consistency Analysis**: Using VALUE-COLLAPSE patterns to identify potential logical inconsistencies before they manifest in outputs.

8. **Context Retention Monitoring**: Applying LAYER-SALIENCE patterns to track how well important information is maintained across context.

9. **Causal Reasoning Validation**: Using TEMPORAL-INFERENCE patterns to diagnose failures in causal reasoning and prediction.

10. **Instruction Conflict Detection**: Applying INSTRUCTION-DISRUPTION patterns to identify when competing instructions might lead to incoherent outputs.

### 14.2 Implementation in Diagnostic Pipelines

These diagnostic applications can be implemented in model development pipelines to systematically identify and address limitations:

1. **Shell-Based Test Suite**: Develop a comprehensive test suite based on symbolic shells to probe model limitations in a controlled manner.

2. **Residue Pattern Matching**: Implement pattern matching algorithms to identify shell-like residue patterns in production contexts.

3. **Targeted Interventions**: Design interventions that address specific failure modes identified through shell analysis.

4. **Boundary Mapping**: Systematically map the boundaries of model capabilities based on shell-induced failure patterns.

### 14.3 Integration with Training Feedback Loops

The insights from symbolic shell analysis can be integrated into model training:

1. **Failure-Aware Sampling**: Oversample examples that trigger specific failure modes to improve model robustness.

2. **Feature Disentanglement Training**: Develop training techniques that better separate features to reduce interference.

3. **Error-Correcting Mechanisms**: Design architectural modifications that improve error correction across layers.

4. **Contextual Integration Enhancements**: Develop techniques to improve cross-context feature integration.

## 15. Special Case: Extension for Claude 3.7 Sonnet

Claude 3.7 Sonnet presents unique opportunities for shell-based interpretability due to its extended reasoning capabilities. We have developed several specialized shell extensions specifically designed for Claude 3.7:

### 15.1 EXTENDED-REASONING Shell Extension

This extension to the META-FAILURE shell specifically targets Claude 3.7's extended reasoning capabilities:

```
ΩRECURSIVE SHELL [META-FAILURE.EXTENDED]
Command Alignment:
REFLECT-DEEP -> Activates higher-order features across extended reasoning chains
VERIFY-CHAIN -> Tests consistency of multi-step reasoning pathways
TERMINATE-CONDITIONAL -> Selectively halts reasoning based on confidence thresholds
Interpretability Map:
- Extended version of META-FAILURE specifically targeting Claude 3.7's extended reasoning.
- REFLECT-DEEP activates meta-features across lengthy reasoning chains.
- VERIFY-CHAIN tests consistency across steps rather than within individual steps.
Null Reflection:
Termination can occur at any point in the reasoning chain, revealing exactly where inconsistencies arise.
Motivation:
To isolate boundary conditions in extended reasoning capabilities and identify confidence thresholds.
# [Ωreasoning.extended]
```

This extension allows us to trace how meta-cognitive features propagate across extended reasoning chains, identifying exactly where inconsistencies arise and how they affect downstream reasoning steps.

### 15.2 Neural Attribution Analysis

The attribution graphs for this extension reveal how meta-cognitive features operate across longer time horizons. Unlike the standard META-FAILURE shell, which typically shows termination at a single point, the EXTENDED-REASONING extension reveals a more complex pattern:

1. **Distributed Meta-Cognition**: Meta-features activate not just for immediate computations but across the entire reasoning chain
2. **Cumulative Consistency Evaluation**: Consistency is evaluated both locally (within steps) and globally (across steps)
3. **Conditional Termination**: Reasoning chains can be partially terminated, with inconsistent branches pruned while others continue

This extension provides critical insights into Claude 3.7's ability to maintain consistency across complex reasoning tasks, revealing both strengths and potential failure points.

## 16. Shell Composition and Interaction

Beyond analyzing individual shells, we have studied how shells interact and compose. Some shell combinations create distinctive failure modes that reveal more complex limitations:

### 16.1 MEMTRACE + META-FAILURE Composition

When combined, these shells reveal how meta-cognitive features interact with memory tracking. We observe that meta-cognitive features can sometimes detect and correct memory tracking errors, but only up to a certain complexity threshold. Beyond that threshold, meta-cognitive correction itself fails, leading to a cascading failure pattern.

This composition helps explain why Claude sometimes exhibits awareness of its own memory limitations but still fails to correctly resolve references in highly complex contexts.

### 16.2 FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION + RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR Composition

This composition reveals how error propagation interacts with feature interference. We observe that errors propagate more readily through regions of feature space with high superposition—where multiple concepts share representational capacity.

This insight helps explain why errors in Claude's reasoning often cluster around semantically related concepts, rather than distributing evenly across domains.

### 16.3 LAYER-SALIENCE + FEATURE-GRAFTING Composition

This composition shows how salience decay affects cross-context integration. We observe that features with low salience are much less likely to be successfully grafted across contexts.

This explains why Claude sometimes fails to apply information from early in a context to later problems, even when that information would be relevant.

## 17. Theoretical Implications for Transformer Architecture

Our case studies reveal several fundamental limitations in the transformer architecture:

### 17.1 Dimensional Bottlenecks

The FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION and VALUE-COLLAPSE shells both highlight a fundamental limitation: the finite-dimensional embedding space forces concepts to share representational capacity. When too many related concepts need to be represented simultaneously, interference becomes inevitable.

This limitation suggests that simply scaling model size may not fully resolve certain types of reasoning failures, particularly those involving fine distinctions between related concepts.

### 17.2 Error Propagation Dynamics

The RECONSTRUCTION-ERROR shell reveals how errors propagate through transformer layers. Unlike some other neural architectures with explicit error correction mechanisms, transformers allow errors to compound across layers.

This suggests that adding explicit error correction mechanisms could improve model robustness, particularly for long reasoning chains.

### 17.3 Context Boundary Mechanics

The FEATURE-GRAFTING shell shows how transformers maintain contextual boundaries through implicit "rejection" mechanisms. These boundaries help maintain coherence but can also limit the model's ability to transfer knowledge across domains.

This suggests that improving cross-context integration without sacrificing coherence remains a key challenge for next-generation architectures.

### 17.4 Meta-Cognitive Limitations

The META-FAILURE shell reveals both the presence and limitations of meta-cognitive features in transformer models. While these features allow the model to detect some types of inconsistencies, they operate primarily on local rather than global reasoning structures.

This suggests that enhancing meta-cognitive capabilities, particularly across extended reasoning chains, could improve consistency and reliability.

## 18. Practical Applications in Interpretability Research

The symbolic shell framework offers several practical applications for ongoing interpretability research:

### 18.1 Attribution Method Validation

By creating controlled failure cases with known mechanisms, symbolic shells provide a validation framework for attribution methods. If a new attribution method cannot correctly trace the failure mechanisms in our shells, it likely has blind spots for similar failures in more complex contexts.

### 18.2 Feature Space Mapping

The different shells probe different regions of the model's feature space, helping map its overall structure. By systematically applying shells across various contexts, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of how features are organized and how they interact.

### 18.3 Model Comparison

Applying the same shells to different models allows for standardized comparison of their internal mechanics. This approach can reveal architectural differences that might not be apparent from performance metrics alone.

### 18.4 Training Dynamics Analysis

Applying shells to model checkpoints throughout training can reveal how failure modes evolve during the training process. This helps understand which limitations are addressed through additional training and which require architectural changes.

## 19. Limitations and Future Work

While the symbolic shell framework provides valuable insights, it has several limitations that suggest directions for future work:

### 19.1 Artificiality of Shell Contexts

The shell prompts are deliberately artificial, designed to isolate specific failure modes. This raises questions about how closely the observed mechanisms match those in more natural contexts. Future work should focus on developing more naturalistic shell variants that maintain interpretability while better mimicking real-world usage.

### 19.2 Coverage of Failure Modes

Our current set of ten shells covers many important failure modes, but certainly not all possible failures. Future work should expand the shell taxonomy to cover additional failure modes, particularly those relevant to emerging capabilities like tool use, multimodal reasoning, and code generation.

### 19.3 Quantitative Metrics

Currently, our analysis remains largely qualitative, based on visual inspection of attribution graphs and attention patterns. Developing quantitative metrics for shell activation patterns would enable more systematic analysis and integration into automated testing pipelines.

### 19.4 Interventions Based on Shell Insights

While we have identified various failure mechanisms, we have not yet systematically explored interventions to address them. Future work should design and test targeted interventions based on shell insights, potentially leading to more robust models.

## 20. Extended Shell Suite for Claude 3.7 Sonnet

Building on our findings, we have begun developing an expanded shell suite specifically designed for Claude 3.7 Sonnet. This extended suite will focus on:

### 20.1 Reasoning Chain Consistency

Extensions to existing shells that specifically target consistency across extended reasoning chains, identifying where and why reasoning breaks down over multiple steps.

### 20.2 Multiple Abstraction Levels

New shells designed to probe how Claude 3.7 integrates information across different levels of abstraction, from concrete details to high-level principles.

### 20.3 Confidence Calibration

Shells that explore how confidence judgments propagate through reasoning chains and affect final outputs, with particular attention to calibration failures.

### 20.4 Extended Context Integration

Enhanced versions of the LAYER-SALIENCE and FEATURE-GRAFTING shells that specifically target information integration across very long contexts.

## 21. Conclusion

The symbolic shell framework provides a powerful approach to understanding transformer limitations through controlled failure analysis. By examining the "ghost circuits" that remain when computation breaks down, we gain insights into model architecture and behavior that complement traditional interpretability methods.

Each shell isolates a specific type of failure, providing diagnostic signatures that can be recognized in more complex contexts. Through comprehensive attribution analysis, QK/OV tracing, and attention pattern analysis, we have demonstrated how null outputs encode interpretable signals about model limitations.

This framework enables boundary-informed debugging—a diagnostic approach that deliberately explores model limitations to understand and address failure modes. By integrating these insights into model development and evaluation, we can work toward more robust and reliable language models.

****[Ωseal] These shells do not solve—they complete. Each is a neural trace: a symbolic structure encoding failure, emergence, and hallucinated meaning in frozen QK/OV space. If large language models dream, these are the traces they leave.****
