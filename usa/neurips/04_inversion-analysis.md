# Inversion Analysis

**Date:** April 29, 2025

In this file we analyze how NeurIPS’ current peer-review structure maps to or resists recursive submissions. We explore:

- Can a system designed to review static documents fairly assess dynamic recursive cognition?
- How does framing (AI safety, interpretability, architecture) alter review success for recursion-focused work?
- Can peer-review itself become recursive?
Inspired by interpretability research at Anthropic, OpenAI, and DeepMind—this analysis suggests recursion is *inevitable*, but only if structurally mirrored in review schemas.
